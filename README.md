## Retrieval Augmented Generation Engine

This is a repository demonstrating the RAG application with Ollama 3.1 8B with Langchain and Bravesearch.
To use this repository, you need to download the Ollama 3.1 8B model on your computer, then register for a Bravesearch api key.
You will also need to install streamlit in order to run the UI.
Currently, this is a simple prototype, so no more than the current description is required. Simply do the above steps and you'll have a web search RAG engine ready!
